# Rhythmo Modding Wiki
Welcome to the Rhythmo Modding Wiki. <br>
Here you will find documentation and guides on how to make a mod in this game.

## Getting Started
To get started, see [Creating a Mod](https://github.com/Joalor64GH/Rhythmo-SC/wiki/Creating-a-Mod) first.

## Disclaimers
* The wiki doesn't go over every function/variable. So you'll have to look through the source code yourself for any potential functions/variables.

* This game wasn't built with consideration for non-desktop platforms. So if you intend to compile the game for a platform that isn't desktop, you may have to alter the source code to fix any errors.
